                    <P> Hi. I’m Abhinav and I love to travel. Plain and simple. And it’s a passionate affair, not
                        hyperbole.
                        I had to write this ‘why I love travelling’ essay to try to express how much I love travel.
                        I started this blog in 2020 to document my trip around the world. Now I’ve been to more than 20
                        countries and counting. My travels have changed and shaped my life.</P>
                    </P>
